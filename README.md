# Mastodon-Bot

In Germany, it is common joke that in a country that is so committed to punctuality and efficiency, the trains are almost always delayed. 

This bot I coded uses an api and takes seven of the busiest train stations in Germany (Frankfurt, Munich, Cologne, Hamburg, Berlin, Stuttgart, and Hanover) and figures out which train is the most delayed between all of them in the next 30 minutes. The bot then posts the output to a mastodon server created for my Networked Media Class.

Expected Output:

Most delayed train:   
From: Frankfurt  
Direction: MÃ¼nchen Hbf    
Line: ICE 591     
Delay: 61 minutes      
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
Percentage of Indexed Trains Experiencing Delays: ~40%
